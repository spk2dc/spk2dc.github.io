I have\n              always had a curiousity to explore the unknown and a passion for\n              seeking out new experiences. The first time I studied abroad in\n              college, I knew I had to do it again and keep wandering as much as\n              I could to see what else was out there just beyond the horizon in\n              places I had never been to before.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              This drive has led me on countless trips to countries scattered\n              across the world, from India to Germany to South Africa to\n              Thailand. Most recently I took my biggest trip of all. In October\n              of 2019 I decided to backpack across Asia for 5 months. I started\n              off traveling through Japan, took a boat to South Korea, then\n              headed to Taiwan. Unfortunately, soon after I arrived in Taiwan,\n              so did the coronavirus pandemic. Despite having to end my trip a\n              little early, I am grateful to have had the opportunity and\n              privelege to take such an extensive trip through so many new\n              places.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Traveling has given me invaluable experiences that have helped me\n              grow as a person and learn about cultures and people different\n              from the ones I have been raised around. Being exposed to diverse\n              perspectives from all over the world has helped give me a unique\n              way of approaching problems and working together with people from\n              all walks of life to solve today's challenges in new ways.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>Below are some of my favorite pictures from my travels.</p>\n          </div>\n\n          <figure className=\"kg-card kg-image-card border border-dark\">\n            <Img\n              fluid={data.resumePic.childImageSharp.fluid}\n              className=\"kg-image\"\n            />\n          </figure>\n        </div>\n      </article>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nconst indexQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n    resumePic: file(relativePath: { eq: \"resume/Resume 2020CS8.png\" }) {\n      childImageSharp {\n        fluid(maxWidth: 1360) {\n          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    resumeFile: file(relativePath: { eq: \"resume/Resume 2020CS8.pdf\" }) {\n      name\n      publicURL\n    }\n  }\n`\n\nexport default props => (\n  <StaticQuery\n    query={indexQuery}\n    render={data => (\n      <TravelPage location={props.location} data={data} {...props} />\n    )}\n  />\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
